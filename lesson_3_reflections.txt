When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Not sure why you even need to use remote instead of local.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sounds like automatic pull is not a good idea, because it doesn't allow you to control what changes are pulled and when. It's better 
To pull manually, so you update you local files when you are ready
